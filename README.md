# backend_group_project
The second DC group project
Tangerine team


## Description

Your task is to form into teams and build something awesome!
You'll be using the backend (and front-end) sills you've developed over the last couple of months.
Each team must present their project on Tuesday, September 4th.
Technical Requirements: front-end

### For the front-end, you have two choices:
Implement a Responsive Web Design that works on Chrome on OSX, iOS devices, and Android devices at 360px, 768px, and 1200+ px wide
You should hand-write as much CSS as possible, though you can lean on CSS frameworks like Bootstrap for typography and form styling.
You can do DOM manipulation with jQuery, but try to lean more towards generating subtrees of DOM elements. (Functions that take data and return DOM elements. Old elements are removed from the page, and these new elements are appended in their place.)

### Technical Requirements: backend

Use Express.js for your HTTP framework.
Use a templating language (EJS is recommended).
Use Postgresql for your database ( Sequelize is optional )
Create tables for at least three related models.
And maybe:
Integrate with an external API.
Or add another model to your application.
